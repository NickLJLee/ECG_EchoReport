The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 20

hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle, and ventricular 
interaction. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right 
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall 
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent

cusp appears slightly larger. The highly mobile, moderate size 
vegetation vs. thrombus is new. Extensive regional dysfunction, 
c/w LAD territory infarction is new and left ventricular cavity 
size has increased. The severity of mitral and aortic 
regurgitation have increased. 

Cardiac cath ___
1.Patent coronary arteries
2.Mild (20%) proximal-mid LMCA 
3.Noted some contrast extravasation on cranial view (sequence 
4)
perhaps represents the ""pseudoaneurysm/channel communicating 
with
LNVOT). This appears to be ___. 

Echo ___:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is an 
aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the level of the aortic root 
(unclear where it originates) with evidence of color Doppler 
flow into the aneurysm. A moderate size density is seen inside 
the aneurym which may be consistent with thrombus or vegetation. 
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline 
dilated. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction with extensive focal hypokinesis of the 
septum, anterior wall, lateral wall, and distal inferior wall 
(EF 30%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
regional dysfunction is more extensive with corresponding 
decline in ejection fraction. The aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm 
appears unchanged and there is color Doppler flow (clips 13, 14) 
from the aorta into the aneurysm with a moderate size mass 
(vegetation vs. thrombus) inside the aneurysm, as previously 
seen.  

CXR ___:
As compared to the previous radiograph, patient is now in 
massive 
pulmonary edema.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is enlarged 
and the 
entire lung parenchyma shows peribronchial cuffing and an 
increase in vascular diameters.  In the lung bases, the changes 
are starting to consolidate and show air bronchograms.  No 
pleural effusions are seen. 

Echo ___:
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ no 
change. 

Echo ___:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately 
depressed (LVEF= ___. Right ventricular chamber size is 
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic 
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic 
valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve 
leaflets appear normal The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets 
appear to move normally. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is 
probably present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the 
aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded. A clear space 
remains anterior to the aortic root which may represent a sinus 
of Valsalva aneurysm/aortic root aneurysm (present for several 
months); an abscess cavity is less likely. There is a mobile 
echodensity seen in the clear space of unclear etiology 
(redundant tissue vs thrombus/vegetation). Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion.

Conclusions   
 The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is critical aortic valve stenosis 
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Conclusions   
 The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is critical aortic valve stenosis 
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal 
(LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the apical septum, with 
focal akinesis, and of the inferior wall. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. Mild to moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function 
is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to inferior

Dyssynchrony is also present, as is direct ventricular 
interaction. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. 
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline 
normal free wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic 
function is likely more depressed given the severity of 
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal 
motion/position consistent with right ventricular 
pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated at

at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There are 
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. 
There is severe bi-leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is flail 
of the P3 scallop of the mitral valve. An eccentric, anteriorly 
directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to 
the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be 
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). Tricuspid valve

abnormal septal motion.  RV is mildly dilated with moderate 
hypokinesis. There is moderate biatrial enlargement.  Aortic 
valve bioprosthesis appears to be well seated with appropriate

PASP is 43 mmHg + CVP.  A minimal pericardial effusion is seen.  
Pacer wire is noted in right heart chambers.  Compared to prior

ETT performed on ___ demonstrated:  
A Dobutamine stress echo was carried out during which time peak 
HR of 127bpm was obtained (86% of maximum predicted HR).  At 
rest, LVEF estimated 25%. Evidence of LVH as well as LAE. Global 
LV systolic dysfunction.  Aortic valve moderately calcified with 
40mmHg peak gradient and 20mmHg mean valve gradient.  This 
represents no significant change from prior study of ___.  
With Dobutamine, LVEF increased to 35-40%.  Again, global 
hypokinesis was seen.  Peak gradient increased to 65mmHg with 
mean gradient of 26 mmHg.  Unfortunately, LVOT velocity could 
not be obtained either at rest or at peak dose Dobutamine, 
therefore aortic valve area could not be calculated.  These 
findings however appear to be most consistent with a 
cardiomyopathy with moderate AS rather than hemodynamic 
insignificant AS.  Suggest clinical correlation.

Conclusions   
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
severely depressed (LVEF = 20 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the 
inferior wall, akinesis of the posterior wall, and extensive 
apical hypokinesis with focal apical akinesis. No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade 
III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The 
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall 
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are 
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is not 
well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left 
atrial pressure. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot

The patient endorses still feeling sluggish with her left leg,
noting that her symptoms have not resolved. 

Regarding days leading up to presentation, the patient notes 
that
she has been struggling with pain in her left hand. For the past
month, she describes intermittent transient severe pain in her
left hand. The day prior to presentation, her left hand was
swollen and in so much pain that she could not make a fist. She
is adamant that she was limited by the pain and not by strength,
noting that she couldn't grip anything because it hurt to bend
her fingers to grasp. The pain went away overnight. She endorses
having these symptoms on/off for the past few months. She has
seen a rheumatologist for this and was told she has a form of
gout. She was prescribed a steroid taper for this, which she
finished several weeks ago. She notes that her left hand joints
appeared to swell with this pain.

normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF = 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no left 
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There

Conclusions  
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a 
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic 
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests impaired relaxation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is at least borderline pulmonary

Conclusions   
Echo performed for intraoperative guidance of left atrial 
appendage ligation via left minithoracotomy. 

 ___:
 The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in 
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The left atrial 
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus 
is seen in the left atrial appendage. 
 In its longest dimension, 3.09cm was measured before the 
exclusion of the left atrial appendage. After exclusion, 2.12cm 
remained.

 RA/IAS:
 No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right 
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

 LV:
 Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). Post exclusion of the left atrial appendage all 
walls (lateral wall included) remained with normal systolic 
function (unchanged).

 RV:
 Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 


 Aorta:
 There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are 
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) 
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 

 AV:
 There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 

 MV:
 The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. 

 TV:
 Normal leaflets, mild TR. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. 

 Pericardium:
 There is no pericardial effusion. No pericardial effusion 
post-procedure.    
   I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance 
with ___ regulations.
